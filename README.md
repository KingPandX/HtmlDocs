# HtmlDocs

A document editor created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Currently, it can only export to PDF and save projects in JSON format.

## How to Start the Program

1. Execute the following command to start the local development server, which hosts the text editor: ```npm run dev```

2. Additionally, run the following command to start another server using Express technology for exporting PDF files (you can skip this step if you don't intend to export to PDF):

    ```npm run pdfServer```

Note:

- By default, the editor uses port **5173**.

- The PDF server uses port **3000**.
